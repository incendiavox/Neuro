Steps to running Simple Neurite Tracer Analyzer

1. Double click application, this should open a window where you can change the parameters depending on ones needs

2. for testing purposes it is easiest to just set the range min at 0 and max at 1000, the other values are preset and should match up with test files, these can be changed to accomadate different formats

3. click "select directory" and navigate to the folder containing the .csv's 

4. select the folder that you want and click ok, it works top down so only the folder needs to be selected not individual files
